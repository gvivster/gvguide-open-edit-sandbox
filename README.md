# gvguide-open-edit-sandbox

This is a repo for these lovely islands in Gather.town, intended to be as close to a collaborative canvas as we can get:
https://app.gather.town/app/QyWZY5n5n3rR6zwl/GVGuide%20Open%20Edit%20Sandbox

### How to do this:

1) Be a member of the Gather Enthusisasts Discord server for more than 3 days. (This is just to filter out some potential abuse.) https://discord.gg/PXGqvXkHc6

2) Message me (Evie) the email you use with Gather, and I'll add you to the space.

3) *** IMPORTANT NOTE before we get to the fun part: BEFORE starting your edit session in Gather.town, post in the private #open-edit-sandbox channel in the Discord!
This is to make sure we don't version each other, as only one person can be editing at a time. ***

4) Edit to your heart's content! Add your own room and connect it to the main island - or use Tiled Map Editor to add your own island to one of the existing maps! Make things and break things! Test out that cool new look, sound effect or extension! I'd say the sky's the limit, but this is the metaverse ðŸ˜Ž

5) For best results, save your map JSON's when you're done - or even better, upload them to this Github. This will allow you to restore things later if they inadvertantly get borked, which is always a possiblility with completely collaborative maps. 
- I'll probably add easy beginner-level instructions to getting map JSON files to your desktop via Postman, so you can work on and re-upload them, but that's a task for another day.
- This is a tool you can use to do it easily (but it does involve a 3rd party being able to see your API key, which not everyone may be comfortable with). If do you use this tool, Backup Map will download the JSON, and Restore Map will upload it again. https://gt-item-shop.web.app/
